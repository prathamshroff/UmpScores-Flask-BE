# RefRating Back-end Repo

### Getting Started:

1. cd into the project
2. Start the virtual environment with the command `source env/bin/activate`
3. Install the required packages with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. At the top level directory, run the command `make` to start the server. This generally takes up to 15 minutes, and will tell you on the terminal when it's done. The server will restart automatically on file changes.
